  <li>Open PlayOnline and go through the prompts using your PlayOnline account you have registered previously. If you don't have an account, you can just enter a faux one that is 4 Letters, followed by 4 numbers (i.e., you can enter <code>ABCD1234</code> if you don't have one).</li>
  <li>Let Playonline update itself if it prompts.  When done, close Playonline.</li>
  <li>Go to <strong>C:\Program Files(x86)\Square Enix\Playonline\Final Fantasy XI</strong> and delete the file FTABLE.DAT</li>
