<h2>Linux Installation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install <strong>Wine</strong> or <strong>Proton</strong>.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/download/media/install_win.html">installer files (download all of them to the same directory!)</a>.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/LandSandBoat/xiloader/releases">xioader.exe</a> <strong>into a directory of its own</strong>.</li>
  <li>Run <strong>FFXIFullSetup_US.part1.exe</strong> to decompress the installer files</li>
  <li>Run <strong>FFXISETUP.exe</strong> after the decompression completes.</li>
  <li>Make sure to <strong>install everything</strong> that prompts on the installer.</li>
  <li>Open PlayOnline Viewer.  If you have never used PlayOnline before, it will prompt you update PlayOnline, do so and make sure to restart PlayOnline after it updates.</li>
  <li>Choose <strong>For PlayOnline Members!</strong></li>
  <li>Go through the prompts using your PlayOnline account you have registered previously. If you don't have an account, you can just enter a faux one that is 4 Letters, followed by 4 numbers (i.e., you can enter <code>ABCD1234</code> for the Member Name and PlayOnline ID.</li>
  <li>It is not required to provide a <strong>PlayOnline Password</strong> or a <strong>SquareEnix ID</strong>, so skip entering those.
  <li><strong>Close PlayOnline</strong>.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the directory that you installed FFXI into.  Continue navigating into the SquareEnix sub-directory followed by the FINAL FANTASY XI sub-directory (for full clarity, the path to the directory you end up at should be <strong>/PlayOnline/SquareEnix/FINAL FANTASY XI</strong>).</li>
  <li>Create a new file called file.txt</li>
  <li>Open file.txt with some type of text editor (such as Vi/VIM editor, Nano editor, Gedit editor, or any other editor of your choice) and populate it with the info below. <strong><mark class="pen-red">Make sure to also add a 3rd empty line!</mark></strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">123456:654321:FTABLE.DAT
::
</code></pre>
<ul>
  <li>Save the file and then exit out of the text editor.</li>
  <li>Open Playonline once more and choose <strong>Check Files</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the next screen, make sure you change the <strong>Playonline-compatible software</strong> choice to <strong>FINAL FANTASY XI</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on <strong>Check Files</strong> to repair the files.</li>
  <li>It should tell that a file is missing and that it needs repair, followed by a long download and install.</li>
  <li>Once it's done repairing files, close Playonline. We can move on to the “Game - First Run” step.</li> 
</ul>
