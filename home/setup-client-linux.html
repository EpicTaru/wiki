<h2>Linux Installation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install Wine or Proton.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://www.playonline.com/ff11us/download/media/install_win.html">installer files (download all of them to the same folder!)</a>.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/kaincenteno/xiloader/releases/tag/v1.2.1.1">xiloader.exe</a>.</li>
  <li>Run <strong>FFXIFullSetup_US.part1.exe</strong> to decompress the installer files</li>
  <li>Run <strong>FFXISETUP.exe</strong> after the decompression completes.</li>
  <li>Make sure to install everything that prompts on the installer.</li>
  <li>Open PlayOnline and go through the prompts using your PlayOnline account you have registered previously. If you don't have an account, you can just enter a faux one that is 4 Letters, followed by 4 numbers (i.e., you can enter <code>ABCD1234</code> if you don't have one).</li>
  <li>Let Playonline update itself if it prompts.  When done, close Playonline.</li>
  <li>Create a new file called file.txt inside <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI</strong></li>
  <li>Open file.txt and populate it with the info below. <mark class="pen-red">Make sure to also add a 3rd empty line.</mark></li>
</ol>

::
</code></pre>
<ol>
  <li>Open Playonline once more and choose <strong>Check Files</strong>.</li>
  <li>On the next screen, make sure you change the <strong>Playonline-compatible software</strong> choice to <strong>FINAL FANTASY XI</strong>.</li>
  <li>Click on <strong>Check Files</strong> to repair the files.</li>
  <li>It should tell that a file is missing and that it needs repair, followed by a long download and install.</li>
  <li>Once it's done repairing files, close Playonline. We can move on to the “Game - First Run” step.</li> 
</ol>
