<p>So far there is documentation here only for <a href="https://xiweb.catsangel.com/">xiweb</a>. xiweb is an AGPL site that collects information from a <a href="https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server">LandSandBoat</a> server running on the same machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please join us on our server.</p>
<p>As we grow bigger will be adding more and more information.</p>

<p>You can find the source of all the wiki files in <a href="https://github.com/kaincenteno/wiki">Github</a>. &nbsp;From there you can create PRs to update the website. I welcome all new info, and grammar corrections as English is my second language.</p>
